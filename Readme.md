> A personal space online for storing and reading books!

## ❓ What is this project about?

This project is focused on building an online personal bookshelf for the community to make reading a bit more elegant. I am using the free mongo cluster, so it isn't possible to store entire books online. Therefore, the users will have to upload the files as pdf in drive / dropbox and link them in or use the project entirely to store bookmarks!

## 💻 Project Development:
  - Backend: [Node, Express, Mongo DB]
  - Frontend: [EJS, CSS, JS]
  - Development Duration: 30.06.2020 - live
  - Acknowledgement: Traversy Media, Dev Ed from YT

## 📜 Usage
- Create a free mongoDB cluster and connect to the project using the connection string.
- *Go through the [how-to-run.md](https://github.com/singhayushh/project_Bookmarks/blob/master/how-to-run.md) for details.*
